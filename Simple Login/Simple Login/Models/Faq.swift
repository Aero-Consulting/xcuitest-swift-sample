            Email alias is similar to forward email address: all emails sent to an alias will be forwarded to your inbox.
            
            Thanks to SimpleLogin technology, an alias can also send emails.
            
            For your contact, the alias is therefore your email address.

            Yes! An email alias is actually a normal email address that exists forever unless you remove it on your SimpleLogin dashboard.

            SimpleLogin alias are permanent as opposed to the temporary emails created on services like temp-mail.org, 10minutemail.net, etc.
            
            SimpleLogin also doesn't store the emails.

            Technically the emails DO arrive at SimpleLogin server and we modify email headers to implement the "magic" but the email content is never read.
